                        Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop 
                        applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single 
                        codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language and provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets.

                        Dart is a programming language optimized for building user interfaces with Flutter. It is an 
                        object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. Dart can compile 
                        to native ARM code for mobile apps and JavaScript for web applications.

                      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                        Widgets are the basic building blocks of a Flutter application's user interface. Everything in 
                        Flutter is a widget, from structural elements like buttons and menus to stylistic elements like 
                        fonts and colors. Widgets are composed together to create complex user interfaces.

                      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                        <strong>Stateless Widget:</strong> Immutable widgets that don't store any mutable state. They are 
                        used when the UI doesn't depend on any changing data. Example: Text, Icon, RaisedButton.
                      </p>
                      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mt-2">
                        <strong>Stateful Widget:</strong> Mutable widgets that can store state that might change during 
                        the widget's lifetime. They are used when the UI needs to update based on changing data. 
                        Example: Checkbox, TextField, Slider.

                        BuildContext is a handle to the location of a widget in the widget tree. Each widget has its 
                        own BuildContext, which is used to reference the widget's location within the tree. It's used 
                        for finding widgets, accessing theme data, and navigating between screens.

                        State management is the process of managing and updating the state of an application. In Flutter, 
                        state refers to any data that can change over time and affects the UI. Common state management 
                        solutions include Provider, BLoC, Riverpod, and Redux.

                      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                        BLoC (Business Logic Component) is a design pattern that helps separate presentation from 
                        business logic. It uses Streams to handle state changes: Events go into the BLoC, and States 
                        come out. The UI listens to state streams and emits events in response to user interactions.
                      </p>

                      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                        <strong>Container:</strong> A basic widget that can contain other widgets and provides padding, 
                        margins, and styling options like background color and borders.
                      </p>

                        <strong>Scaffold:</strong> A higher-level widget that provides the basic material design 
                        visual layout structure, including AppBar, FloatingActionButton, Drawer, and BottomNavigationBar.
                      </p>

                      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                        Keys are used by Flutter to identify and preserve widgets when they are reordered or modified. 
                        They help Flutter understand which widgets correspond to which elements in the widget tree, 
                        preventing unnecessary rebuilds and maintaining state.
                      </p>

                      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                        <strong>Hot Reload:</strong> Updates the UI with new changes without losing the current 
                        application state. It's faster and preserves the app's state.
                      </p>
                      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mt-2">
                        <strong>Hot Restart:</strong> Reloads the entire application from scratch, losing the current 
                        state but incorporating all changes. It's slower than Hot Reload but ensures a clean state.

                        <strong>Widget Tree:</strong> A configuration of widgets that describes the UI. It's immutable 
                        and represents what the UI should look like.
                      </p>

                        <strong>Element Tree:</strong> The actual instantiation of widgets at specific locations in the 
                        tree. Elements are mutable and manage the lifecycle and state of widgets.
                      </p>

                      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                        Isolates are independent workers that run in separate memory spaces and communicate via messages. 
                        Dart uses isolates for concurrency, allowing multiple threads to execute simultaneously without 
                        sharing memory. Flutter's main UI runs on the main isolate.

                        <strong>Future:</strong> Represents a single value that will be available in the future.

                        Mixins are a way to reuse a class's code in multiple class hierarchies. They allow you to 
                        add functionality to classes without using inheritance. In Flutter, mixins are commonly used 
                        for features like animation controllers and change notifications.

                        <strong>final:</strong> Variables that can be assigned only once. The value can be determined 
                        at runtime.

                        <strong>const:</strong> Compile-time constants. The value must be known at compile time and 
                        cannot change. Used for creating immutable objects and optimizing performance.

                        • Use const constructors for widgets that don't change<br/>
                        • Implement lazy loading with ListView.builder<br/>
                        • Use Image.cache() for frequently used images<br/>
                        • Avoid unnecessary widget rebuilds with proper state management<br/>
                        • Use the performance profiler to identify bottlenecks<br/>

                        RepaintBoundary is a widget that creates a separate display list for its child. This prevents 
                        the child from being repainted when the parent repaints, improving performance for complex 
                        widgets that don't change frequently.
